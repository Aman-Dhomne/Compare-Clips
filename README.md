# Video Similarity Comparison with Python

This Python program allows users to compare two video clips frame by frame and display their similarity percentage. It utilizes NumPy, OpenCV, and scikit-learn libraries to perform video analysis and similarity computation.

## Features

- Compares two video clips frame by frame
- Calculates and displays the similarity percentage between the two clips
- Utilizes NumPy, OpenCV, and scikit-learn for efficient video analysis and similarity computation

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Place the two video clips you want to compare in the project directory.
2. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py --video1 clip1.mp4 --video2 clip2.mp4
```

3. The program will compare the two video clips frame by frame and display their similarity percentage.
